# filaAgil
## Description
This is a web application to make orders in buffet-like restaurants without having to be in long lines or waiting for the waiter.

## Motivation
This is a project for a web development class in [Uniandes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co). The objective is to make a quick project using node, MongoDB and ReactJS. We have decided to make this project after [Juan Sebastian](https://github.com/jsbarragan796) saw a lot of problems happening on a buffet restaurant due to lack of organization on how the restaurant was taking the orders.

## Getting Started
if you want to run this project you are going to need ```npm```(or ```yarn```) and ```mongodb```. We recommend you to use env variables to connect to the db.

## Deployment
Once you have what you need and the proyect downloaded into your pc, open a console and enter en "front end" folder and run:
* ```npm install```
* ```npm start build```

that way you will have the Reactjs front end application ready. Now go back to the main folder and run:
* ```npm install```
* ```npm start```

Then the app will be up and running
