# filaAgil
## Description
This is a web application to make orders in buffet-like restaurants without having to be in long lines or waiting for the waiter.

## Motivation
This is a project for a web development class in [Uniandes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co). The objective is to make a quick project using node, MongoDB and ReactJS. We have decided to make this project after [Juan Sebastian](https://github.com/jsbarragan796) saw a lot of problems happening on a buffet restaurant due to lack of organization on how the restaurant was taking the orders.
